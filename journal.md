- setting up big.js. This is a dependency that will help with large numbers, high precision decimals and the maths required to manipulate them.
  - The reasoning behind this is that javascript (and computers in general) cannot store certain numbers with perfect accuracy using finite floating data types. This is because binary is a base 2 system, so numbers like 0.1 do not have a neat binary representation (it goes on forever).
  - It would be like trying to represent 1/3 with a base 10 system (decimals). 0.3333...
  - In javascript, the digits needed to represent a number like 0.1 exceeds the 64 bits assigned to numbers. This means trying to use vanilla javascript for calculations may introduce some rounding errors.
  - What big.js does to solve this is it converts numbers into a string and stores each digit in an array. By extracting the integers from a number (big or small), javascript can accurately represent and compute them since integers can be described nicely by binary. Once the computations are done, big.js can revert the numbers back using the sign and exponent that it knows about the number.
  - e.g., 0.1 + 0.2 might extract the 1 from 0.1, 2 from 0.2, add them, then apply the exponent of -1 to turn 3 into 0.3. This way, the accuracy is preserve at the cost of more memory and computation
